<h2 style="color:black">What are Dental Sealants</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">

Dental sealant is a thin, plastic coating painted on the chewing surfaces of teeth -- usually the back teeth (the premolars and molars) -- to prevent tooth decay. The sealant quickly bonds into the pits and grooves of the teeth, forming a protective shield over the enamel of each tooth.
<br><br>
Although brushing usually will keep you teeth clean but the brushing action tend to leave spots as it cannot reach every nook and cranny. Thats where sealants shine. Sealants are applied professionally and will cover all of your tooth surface. Sealants literally - seals out - any opening where plague can deposit.

<h2 style="color:black">Who should get sealants</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
Sealants are usually suggested for children under the age of 19, usually when they start growing their permanent molars.  

Highly effective in preventing decay on the biting surfaces of your chewing teeth, applying sealant is a straight forward procedure with no needles and no pain. The dentist will apply these tooth-colored acrylic coating, just painted onto the surface of the tooth. This effectively - seals - the deep pits and grooves acting as a barrier, protecting enamel from plaque and acids.

Sealants protect the depressions and grooves of your teeth from food particles and plaque that brushing and flossing cannot reach.

Easy to apply, sealants take only a few minutes to seal each tooth. Sealants hold up well under the force of normal chewing and can last several years before a reapplication is needed.  If kids start with sealants they will be a step ahead against the fight for tooth decay at an early age.

<h4><p class="text-justify">
<b style="color:red"> What Do sealant's look like? </b>
<br><br>
Sealants can be clear, white, or slightly tinted. Usually, you cannot see a sealant when a child talks or smiles.
<br><br>

<b style="color:red"> How long sealant's last? </b>
<br><br>
Sealants usually do not wear of quickly. Since they bond with the teeth, and in most cases will usually last 2-4 years. In some instances they may wear off quickly, but that usually depends on the childs orale hygiene. Its recommended that during your routine dental visits, ask the dentist to check and if required let him reapply the sealant. Once the sealant is gone the protective shield is gone. Therefore a reapplication is always a good idea.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Sealants usually do not taste anything. They are desgined to be tastelss. And after an application your child want feel much of anything. In some rare instances, the child may feel the sealant with thier tongue but that effect will soon dies once the sealant dries and absorbed by the tooths pit and grooves. 
<br><br>

<b style="color:red"> How much does dental sealant's cost? </b>
<br><br>
Sealants are usually covered by insurance. So if you have dental insurance, there may be no cost or very little cost. Sealants are always cheaper than letting a tooth decay. A decayed tooth will eventually require dental filling, which will be more expensive.
