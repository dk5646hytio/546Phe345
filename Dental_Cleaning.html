<h2 style="color:black">What will be done during my Dental Cleaning</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
Many folks dread the dentist and dental cleaning. Between the strange noises of the drill and all staff clad in scrubs no doubt it can be scary. <br><br> Dread not, and read on... its usually a painless experience and its extremely important for your teeths well being to go see a dentist and have your cleaning done every six month. Most importantly most insurance will cover cleaning at 100%, so there is usually little or no out of pocket cost.

<br><br> 
During your dental cleaning the dentist will remove plaque and tartar. But before that is done, usually the condition of your gums will be assessed and charted. This is called periodontal charting <a title="Periodontal Charting" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_charting" target="_blank">More info at wikipedia</a>.  Perio-charting, is the measuring of periodontal pockets.  Through these measurements, your dentist wil be able to accurately diagnose the presence of gum disease, and how much it has advanced.

Once charting is out of the way the actual cleaning starts. Every cleaning is done using - an ultrasonic scaler called the Cavitron.  The cavitron is an advance instrument that distributes ultrasonic vibrations which literally removes tartar and calculus off of your teeth. 

<br><br> 
The Cavitron work on the function of vibration( ultrasonic waves), it produces sound waves to break apart stubborn calculus. Water flows out of the cavitron tips to wash away debris and keep the scaler from overheating. Dont be afraid you want feel the the vibrations or hear the sound waves, you will most likely notice that your teeth feeling cleaner. 

<br><br>
By the end of your cleaning you will have greatly reduced the amount of plaque bacteria that causes most dental diseases.
<br><br>
Keeping a regular cleaning routine is VERY important. Some patients might need to come in every three or four months, due to the advanced level of gum disease.

<h2 style="color:black">Polishing</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
After your teeth are completely cleaned, the dentist brushes them with a high-powered electric brush. During this process you will feel a grinding noise. While it sounds scary, its a great way to get a deep clean and remove any tartar left behind from the cavitron.

Usually during the polishing phase a toothpaste that smells and tastes like regular toothpaste is used. However, it has a gritty consistency that gently scrubs your teeth. If done by a professional, this polishing of the teeth is deemed safe to do twice a year. But do not be as harsh with your teeth at home, because you will wear down the enamel.
