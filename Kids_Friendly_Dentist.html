<h2 style="color:black">We are a Kids Friendly Dental office in Hackensack NJ</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
As a kid friendly dentist in Hackensack we treat toddlers, young children including preschooler and elementary age children as well as teenagers. We realize that a lot of parents do not bring their child to the dentist until they are much older. This, however, is a mistake. Children has most propensity to develop caries and decay and most insurance covers kids routine dental checkup, dental cleaning as well as dental sealants with little or no out of pocket cost. Understand that your child will develop cavities as young as their toddler years and visiting our kid friendly dentist office is one way to help prevent them.<br> 

<h2 style="color:black">Tooth Decay a major cause of concern.</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
As a parent, we all want the best for our child. Most of us are unware of how oral health and dental care can prevent dental issues at an early age. According to the Center for Disease Control, tooth decay (cavities) is the number one most commonly occurring infectious disease among children. This leads to children experiencing toothaches in high numbers, missing days from school, and experiencing overall discomfort. 
<br><br>
Tooth decay is not a trivial thing, but a condition that can create significant discomfort for your child and even make it difficult for them to eat, speak clearly, and engage in normal daily activities. If you live in the Hackensack area and you think that this will not happen to your child the data is perhaps disagreeing with you. as most kids will develop cavities. Brushing and flossing at home will help, but it is not enough. You need to bring your child to our kid friendly dentist office twice a year so that we can examine and clean their teeth. By doing this, we will be able to remove the plaque and bacteria that can lead to cavities in the first place.</p>

<h2 style="color:black">How to prevent Cavities among Pediatric Dental patients?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
As a kid friendly dentist office in Hackensack, we are focused on preventative care. Preventative treatments include, keeping your teeth cleaning. Its recommended that you make your kids brush twice a day and keep their teeth clean.  It is far better for your child to visit us for a regular teeth cleaning than to only see us only when they are having an unbearable toothache. In addition to cleaning their teeth, another preventative dental treatment is dental sealant. Many children have deep ridges in their teeth. When they bite down and chew food, bacteria, food particles, and plaque can become trapped in those ridges and eventually they will create tooth decay.  These areas are particularly difficult to clean with a toothbrush alone, so even the most fastidious of parents may find it challenging to keep cavities at bay. By using dental sealant, a protective layer is placed onto the teeth so that nothing can get stuck in these ridges. The procedure is painless and fast since all we need to do is brush the sealant onto the teeth and allow it to harden.

<h2 style="color:black">What is Dental fluoride treatment?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
Dental fluoride  is a strong mineral that builds strong teeth and prevents cavities. Kids are at high risk of developing cavities and dental fluoride is especially helpful. When you visit us for your routine pediatric dental checkup, ask us for flouride treatment. Most insurance will cover flouride treatment for children at little to no out of pocket cost. If you live in the Hackensack area, we invite you to schedule a dental exam by calling <b>{% if site.contact.phone %}<strong style="color:red"></strong> <a style="color:red" href="tel:{{ site.contact.phone }}" title="{{ site.contact.phone }}" > {{ site.contact.phone }}  </a></b>{% endif %}.Dr Kathawala routinely see kids and 40% of her patient population is pediatric dental patient.</p>


<h2 style="color:black">Frequently asked questions (FAQ) about Kids Friendly Dentist</h2>

<h4><p class="text-justify">

Thirdly see that you have no unexpected out of pocket cost or a surprise bill after the visit.
<br><br>

<b style="color:red"> Does my child need regular fluoride treatments?</b>
<br><br>

Overtime the fluoride that was applied will wash away. Therefore its recommended that on all your routine dental visit have the flouride reapplied. Most insurance plans cover flouride treatment every six month  or twelve month, with little or no out of pocket cost, because its a recommended preventative treatment per the ADA. <br><br>


<b style="color:red"> How much does Kids Dental checkup cost? </b>
<br><br>
Usually most insurance plans will cover your routine dental checkup at 100% with a deductible. Therefore if you have insurance then there may be little or no out of pocket cost. Actually most insurance companies encourage their patients to go see a dentist every six months, as early detection of any issue will largely be taken care of much easily. If you do not routinely see a dentist then most likely you will end up in a dental emergency and then it is usually too late to save your tooth and the cost will always be much higher.
