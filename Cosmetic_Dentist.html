<h4><p class="text-justify">
<b style="color:red"> Can I eat normally and will the smile makeover feel natural? </b>
<br><br>
Depending on what procedures were done, a smile makeover in most instances will feel natural. For example if you have bonding done, then you can eat and chew normally. However do not bite hard or open beer bottles with your bonded teeth. If you have implants done supported by implant crown, they will feel and work like natural teeth. Though, if not properly cared for or abused by biting hard or grinding etc., even implant supported crown may get damaged overtime.
