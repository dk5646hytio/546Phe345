  description: Dr. Kathawala is THE BEST DENTIST! I became her patient 5 years ago and from my very first appointment with her she has always catered to my needs and she always greets me with a smile! Dr. Kathawala is an amazing dentist and makes it her mission to leave me satisfied with her services everytime I have an appointment. I appreciate her so much that I travel from Queens to Bayonne every 6 months just for my dentist appointment. Dr. Kathawala is simply and TRULY the best! <a style="color:red" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthgrades.com/dentist/dr-samina-kathawala-g9dkw"> Click here to check out her review's on HealthGrade.</a></p>

  description: I have been to a dentist but no one explained me the way Dr kathawala Explained my mouth condition I always have the gum problem ,she explained me what it is and how it can be treated, since that time onwards on every appointment she use to check my oral hygiene and explain again if I am not following what she explained. My gums have improved a lot.I have never seen a dentist who takes care of patient so much. I would highly recommend her who really wants to take care of their teeth. And wants the right treatment. <a style="color:red" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Dr-Samina-Kathawala-325513541239783/reviews/?ref=page_internal"> Click here to check out her review's on Facebook.</a></p>
