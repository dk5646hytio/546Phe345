<h2 style="color:black">What are dentures?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
A denture, is a removalable set of teeth, called an appliance in dental parlance, that is inserted in the mouth. It replaces your natural teeth. There are three main types of dentures: temporary denture, partial denture, and complete denture. 
<br><br> 

 <ul class="text-justify">
	<li><b style="color:red">  Temporary Denture  </b><br><br>  
	Temporary denture is usually used for temporary purposes when you are undergoing a cosmetic dentistry procedure to replace a missing tooth. Temporaries ensure that patients throughout the Hackensack  area have a natural looking smile while waiting for their implant or bridge to be completed. This is an excellent solution, when a tooth is knocked out during a sports game or in an accident. 
<br><br>  
	The temporary denture is secured in place with a metal wire that works like a retainer and can be taken in and out whenever you like. If you are looking for an immediate solution for replacing a missing tooth call us <b>{% if site.contact.phone %}<strong style="color:red"></strong> <a style="color:red" href="tel:{{ site.contact.phone }}" title="{{ site.contact.phone }}" > {{ site.contact.phone }}  </a></b>{% endif %}.  Keep in mind that a temporary denture is only meant to be worn for a few months and will need to be replaced.
<br><br>  

	<li><b style="color:red">  Partial Denture  </b><br><br>  
If only a few of your teeth are missing, then partial denture is a good solution. Since you have some of your teeth, those teeth will support the partial denture. Unlike a full set of dentures, a partial denture is held in place by a plastic base that is the same color as your gums. A metal retainer is typically latched, which helps in securing the base and prevent it from falling out. 
<br><br>  
As long as you have natural teeth in place, a partial set of dentures is recommended. We treat patients throughout the Hackensack area and many times patient's want to know if a partial denture is better than a cosmetic dental procedure. Understand that they function differently because dentures are removable and cosmetic dentistry solutions are typically permanent. Partial dentures are a economical solution as oppose to cosmetic procedures such as implants, which may be more expensive to place. Call us <b>{% if site.contact.phone %}<strong style="color:red"></strong> <a style="color:red" href="tel:{{ site.contact.phone }}" title="{{ site.contact.phone }}" > {{ site.contact.phone }}  </a></b>{% endif %} if you have any questions or want to understand your options.
<br><br>  

	<li><b style="color:red">  Complete  Denture  </b><br><br>  
When all of your teeth are missing, complete dentures is the option. Complete denture repalces all your teeth. Usually you will need an upper denture for the upper jaw and a lower denture for the lower jaw. If tooth extraction was done to put dentures, then usually you will have to wait a few weeks till the gum heals and then we will work on getting you dentures. Denture setup will require a couple of visit as we take great care in making sure it fits and you are comfortable wearing them. <br><br>  
Many patients throughout New Jersey prefer not to wait and get immediate dentures. However if you require immediate denture there will no waiting period, but there will be adjustments later on after the gums and bone have settled into their permanent size. We are usually asked if we recommend immediate denture or not, the answer is usually not straight forward. In most instances, its better to let your gums heal, and you may be better off with a complete set of denture. In situations where you want to have the denture's done right after your teeth are removed then immediate denture is an option.

<h2 style="color:black">How can I get dentures?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">

In order for dentures to be created, on your first appointment the dentist will examine your gum's and overall oral health to determine if dentures are the best solution for you and if so, which type. A mold will then be taken of your teeth and gum's so that the dentures can be created in a dental lab. Typically, several molds will be generated from the impression that will be taken. Using these impressions, the lab will make a set of dentures that look natural and fit's perfectly. We strive to make sure that your are comfortable and that it fits perfectly. Therefore if necessary, adjustments will be required and will be made as needed. We can discuss the process in more detail during a consultation. Call us <b>{% if site.contact.phone %}<strong style="color:red"></strong> <a style="color:red" href="tel:{{ site.contact.phone }}" title="{{ site.contact.phone }}" > {{ site.contact.phone }}  </a></b>{% endif %} if you want to make an appointment. <br><br>

<h2 style="color:black">Advantages of Dentures?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">

Dentures are an economical solution for patients who have no teeth left (complete denture) or have missing teeth (partial denture). We strive for quality and use the best labs and make every effort for your denture to fit well and feel natural. However some patients do not like the feel of the denture and are never comfortable wearing them. If thats the case then we can help with alternative solutions, such as <b>implant over denture</b>. Implants will be placed in your jaw bone and then denture will be permanently placed on those implants. Dentures supported by implants will feel in every way natural. Though they are more expensive then dentures, but in the long run it greatly improves quality of life and its well worth the initial cost. We understand that not all patients can afford implant supported denture, in those instances we will gladly make dentures for you. We will be happy to meet you and offer you all the options. Call us <b>{% if site.contact.phone %}<strong style="color:red"></strong> <a style="color:red" href="tel:{{ site.contact.phone }}" title="{{ site.contact.phone }}" > {{ site.contact.phone }}  </a></b>{% endif %} if you want to make an appointment. <br><br>

<h2 style="color:black">Alternatives to Dentures?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">

<b>Implant over Denture</b>. Implants are placed in your jaw bone and then dentures are supported onto the implants. Implant over denture will greatly enhance your quality of life, since most patients do not like the dentures in their mouth because it doesnt feel natural. Implant over denture is a great alternative. Given the advancement in implant technology and very high success rate, patients are usually very happy with our implant over denture outcomes.   
<h4> </h2>

<h2 style="color:black">How do I care for my Denture?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
Take your denture out every night. This is a must. If you do not take the denture out then overtime bacteria will build up and will greatly affect your overall oral health. Since your denture's are not clean it will create other unwanted problems.Rinse your denture thoroughly then use a denture brush to remove any food particles and then rinse them again. Also brush your gums, tongue, and the roof of your mouth with a soft toothbrush and toothpaste. You can use an antiseptic mouthwash afterwards to kill any lingering bacteria and improve your breath. Your dentures should soak all night and then they will be ready for use the next morning.

<h2 style="color:black">Frequently asked questions (FAQ) about Dentures</h2>

<h4><p class="text-justify">
<b style="color:red"> Can I eat normally and will the dentures feel natural? </b>
<br><br>
Most patients need to learn how to use dentures properly and as a result, it takes a little time to get used to them. After a while, you should be able to eat normally. However be realistic in your expectation, because it may take time to get comfortable. Initially the denture may move on your jaw and using a small amount of denture adhesive (no more than three or four pea-sized dabs on each denture) may help stabilize the dentures and help hold them in place while you learn how to get comfortable with them. Overtime you will feel normal using them and will feel just fine. Please do not chew gum with your dentures. Gum has the tendency to stick to yur dentures and it will in some rare instances break the acrylic plastic, that the denture is made of. 
<br><br>

<b style="color:red"> When is time to reline my denture? </b>
<br><br>
Overtime with use the denture may not fit and work as well as when it was new. Non fitting old dentures need relining. It is best not to reline your dentures with over-the-counter reline kits. Doing so may permanently damage your denture and will cost a lot more if you have to remake them. This procedure, which can be done by your dentist, will enable your dentures to have a tighter, better fit. With dentures the fit and feel is most critical and therefore its highly recommended that you go to a professional. Here in our office in Hackensack we routinely reline dentures. Just call us  <b>{% if site.contact.phone %}<strong style="color:red"></strong> <a style="color:red" href="tel:{{ site.contact.phone }}" title="{{ site.contact.phone }}" > {{ site.contact.phone }}  </a></b>{% endif %} and we will be happy to help.  
<br><br>

<b style="color:red"> I have been wearing denture for a while and I am noticing that I am losing gum and bone. Can this be fixed?? </b>
<br><br>
Research shows that once the teeth are removed, the jaw bone shrinks and changes in shape. Typically, dentures should be checked every year, and often they should be remade when they lose their fit and are loose in your mouth. While natural teeth helps prevents shrinkage of jaw bone, but once those teeth are removed, this is body's natual adjustment. However as long as you keep good oral hygiene and make sure the denture is fitting well then the loss of jaw bone will be somewhat reduced, though it cannot be reversed. <br><br>

<b style="color:red"> How much does denture cost? </b>
<br><br>
Price varies widely depending on the materials used. Also while shopping for dentures make sure the dentist is willing to spend time helping you with fit and adjustment over time. It shall not be a one time transaction. If the price is low then its likely that you want get much service after the denture is placed. Also a low price may be indicative of inferior material being used, as fabrication prices vary widely depending on quality.
