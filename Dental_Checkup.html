<h2 style="color:black">What will be done during my Dental Check up</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">

Routine dental check includes -  dental cleaning, a complete full mouth exam by our dentist and, if any X rays are required they will be taken during your visit. 

<br> 

<h2 style="color:black">Why is Oral Hygiene important?</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
Most adults start losing teeth because they fail to maintain good oral hygiene. Gum or periodontal disease and decay are both caused by bacteria and plaque. Plaque is a colorless coat of film, that sticks to your teeth at the gum line. Plaque constantly accumulates behind your teeth and is not readily visible. It usually has harmful bacteria that overtime eats your gums. <br><br>  By daily brushing and flossing you can remove the plaque and the germs and help prevent long term damage to your teeth. Flossing is extremely important as it removes any food stuck between your teeth. The food that sticks to your teeth helps bacteria grow and multiply, since they eat those tiny food particles. Therefore make it a habit to brush daily and floss daily.

<h2 style="color:black">Good Nutrition is key to healthy teeth.</h2>
<h4><p class="text-justify">
A balanced diet keep you healthy so its important to always eat healthy and exercise.
<br><br>  
How often and what you eat has direct correlation to your dental health. Starchy foods such as cookies, bread, and candy helps the bacteria in your mouth, since they feed on sugars in your mouth left over by these starchy foods. The bacteria's consume these sugars and produces acids that attack your teeth as long as it remains in your mouth. Enamel is the protective coating on your teeth. Food especially candy that stick to your teeth or are slow to dissolve give the acids in your mouth more time to work on and aids in destroying your tooth enamel. <br><br>  Therefore resist the temptation of eating candies. And if you do eat them then rinse your mouth with water after you are done eating them.

While dental X-rays do involve radiation, the exposed levels are so low that they're considered safe for children and adults. And with digital X-rays your risks from radiation exposure is even lower. Our office is completely digital and we do not use old style X rays and hence the radiation levels are very low. 

To further protect you we use a bib to prevent your body from radiation. 

If you are pregnant then let us know and we will not take your x rays.  Women who are pregnant or believe they may be pregnant should avoid all types of X-rays.
